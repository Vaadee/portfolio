Mayhap is a whimsical Python package that allows you to introduce controlled randomness into your function executions. By decorating your functions with `@maybe`, you can specify various probability distributions to determine whether a function should execute or not. It's perfect for simulations, testing, or just adding a bit of unpredictability to your code.
